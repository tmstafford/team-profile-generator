# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This is a command-line application build using Node.js that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user is prompted for information about the team manager, name, ID, email address, and office number, and is then presented with a menu where they can choose to add an engineer or intern to the team, or finish building their team. When an engineer is added, the user is prompted to enter the engineer's name, ID, email, and GitHub username. When an intern is added, the user is prompted to enter the intern's name, ID, email, and school name. 

When the user is finished building their team, they answer 'No' when prompted if they want to add more members, and the HTML file is generated and stored in the dist/ folder, along with a CSS stylesheet. Open the HTML file in the browser to see the finished Team Profiles Webpage!
